# GraphBased-PathPlanningAlgo

Practice project to master the concepts of path planning algorithms.

## First Step: Create a Maze using Kruskal's Algorithm

This project involves creating a maze using Kruskal's algorithm. The maze is displayed using Pygame.

### Define Constants

- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` of the frame:
  ```python
  WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 600
  ROWS, COLS = 10, 10
  CELL_SIZE = WIDTH // COLS
